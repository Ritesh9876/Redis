Commands:


g++ -Wall -Wextra -O2 -g client.cpp -o client

g++ -Wall -Wextra -O2 -g server.cpp hashtable.cpp thread_pool.cpp zset.cpp heap.cpp avl.cpp  -o server


Commands can you try:
./client set k 399
./client get k
./client del k
./client zadd zset 1 n1
./client zadd zset 2 n2
./client zadd zset 1.1 n1
./client zscore zset n1
./client zquery zset 1 "" 0 10
./client zrem zset adsf
./client zrem zset n1
./client zquery zset 1 "" 0 10

Accept() sysCall:

/*
        The accept() function shall extract the first connection on the queue of pending connections, create a new socket with the same socket type protocol and address family as the specified socket, and allocate a new file descriptor for that socket. The file descriptor shall be allocated as described in File Descriptor Allocation.
        */

        /*
            The accept() syscall also returns the peerâ€™s address. The addrlen argument is both the input size and the output size.
            1. Second Argument: Either a null pointer, or a pointer to a sockaddr structure where the address of the connecting socket shall be returned.

Pointers: 

htab->tab[pos] -> [Node1] -> [Node2] -> [Node3] -> NULL

Understanding Connections :->

from:
from is a pointer to the location where the address of Node1 is stored. Let's say the address of htab->tab[pos] is 0x100.
Example: from = &htab->tab[pos]; means from holds 0x100.


*from:
*from is the address stored at from, which is the address of Node1. Let's say the address of Node1 is 0x200.
Example: *from = htab->tab[pos]; means *from holds 0x200.


**from:
**from is the actual Node1 data located at the address 0x200.
Example: **from dereferences 0x200 to access the Node1 structure.
